# CriminalIntent

The purpose of this application was to create an application that displays a list of crimes to the user.  
The view of this list utilizes a RecyclerView to support adding and holding multiple crimes.
This app also utilizes Room and LiveData to store and modify crimes.

This program was created following the tutorial specified in Chapters 8-14 of *Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide, 4th Edition*
